            A demo for Changed-special is currently available under "Tools" in your library if you own Changed. You can also access it from the main menu of Changed.
            When the game is finished, every user who bought Changed will get the full version of the special edition for free,
            it will switch places with the original, both being permanently available to anyone who buys Changed on Steam.
