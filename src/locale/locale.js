            The game is much bigger overall, with more rooms, puzzles, encounters, animations, pictures, characters and story. Existing content was also updated in every way.
            It also addresses the big imperfections in the original, such as the RNG reliance.
            A demo for Changed-special is currently available under "Tools" in your library if you own Changed. You can also access it from the main menu of Changed.
            When the game is finished, every user who bought Changed will get the full version of the special edition for free,
            it will switch places with the original, both being permanently available to anyone who buys Changed on Steam.
            The Changed-special currently on Steam is just a demo.
            It is not kept up-to-date with latest development versions.
            The latest development versions are a reward for Patreon supporters, who help with development.`
